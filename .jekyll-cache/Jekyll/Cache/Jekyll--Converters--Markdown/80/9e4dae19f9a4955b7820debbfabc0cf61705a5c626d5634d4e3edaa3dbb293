I"1<p>How do take an already amazing theme like <a href="https://github.com/chesterhow/tale">Tale</a> and make it better? Yup, dark-mode<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. That and some more changes under the hood is what led to this theme called Tail (as a hat tip to the original theme of course)</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>For now, there is no toggle button for the dark mode. This is by design. I wanted the dark-mode to be on if the browser or system level dark-mode is enabled. Maybe, in a later version, I will add support for a dark/light toggle. Happy to accept a PR!Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
